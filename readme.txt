WP Listings Pro is a plugin designed to manage both listings and agents, along with the integration of the two, for WordPress websites. Included is IDX Broker importing handling.

== Description ==
WP Listings Pro is a plugin to manage listings and agents on your WordPress website. Its based off of the original WP Listings plugin, along with the IMPress Agents plugin. This plugin manages listings and listing data, including property details, associated pictures, and sold status. Also included is full support for an IDX Broker API, for importing listings through an MLS feed.

Automatic support for switching from IMPress Listings! We automatically reformat data that needs to be reformatted, into a better display type, so your data will still be there. We also provide support for including agents, and assigning them to listings, along with editing their data as needed. This means you no longer need IMPress Agents or the Posts 2 Posts plugin.

We do recommend you also check out our other plugin [Real Estate Pro](https://wordpress.org/plugins/re-pro/) as well.

== Installation ==
1. Deactivate any other listing/employee plugins.

2. Install from the WP Admin dashboard, or download the archive and install the archive under the Plugins menu, Add New, Upload Plugin. Or you can unzip the contents of the archive into your wordpress directory under wp-content/plugins/.

3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins page on the WP Admin page.

4. Start adding/importing listings!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q: Will my previous listings/employees be migrated when installing this plugin?
A: Yes! All data will be automatically migrated (MAKE SURE YOU DEACTIVATE ANY OTHER PLUGINS, AS THERE MAY BE CONFLICTS IN HANDLING YOUR DATA).

Q: The imports page is blank. What\'s up?
A: Make sure to have an IDX plugin installed ([IDX Broker is a fine one](https://wordpress.org/plugins/idx-broker-platinum/)) and that you have an API key installed. MLS feeds are not mandatory for the plugin to work, but they do make your life easier.

Q: That\'s not a lot of FAQ\'s, where else can I ask questions?
A: Our email, [support@imforza.com](support@imforza.com) is always available, in case you have any questions about installation/usage.
